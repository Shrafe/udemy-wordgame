# udemy-wordgame

This game is an implementation of the "Bulls and Cows" game from the Udemy Unreal 4 course. Users can select a word length, and the goal of the game is to guess the hidden word using the clues. Bulls indicate a correct letter in the correct place, and a Cow is a correct letter in an incorrect place. The game is based upon the Mastermind board game.

Give it a whirl! Build in Visual Studio 2015. If you find any bugs feel free to open an issue ;)
